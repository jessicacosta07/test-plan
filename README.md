## Test Plans

The test plan describes the scope of the overall testing effort and provides a record of the test planning process. A test plan identifies requirements, risks, test cases, test environments to be tested, business and quality objectives, test plans, and other items.

It is worth mentioning that testing should not be the last activity in the software development process. It occurs throughout the process, as exemplified in the RUP (Rational Unified Process) process overview.

To carry out software testing involves answering the following questions:

1. Which quality attributes should be tested?

2. Who will perform the tests?

3. What resources will be used?

4. What are the dependencies between quality attributes?

5. What are the dependencies between development activities?

6. How will the process and quality of the software system be monitored?
   

A test plan should define:

1. The items to be tested: the scope and objectives of the plan must be established at the beginning of the project.

2. Activities and resources to be used: the testing strategies and resources used must be defined, as well as any and all restrictions imposed on the activities and/or resources.

3. The types of tests to be carried out and tools used: the types of tests and the chronological order of their occurrence are established in the plan.

4. Criteria to evaluate the results obtained: metrics must be defined to monitor the results achieved.

Different Types of Software Testing:

1. Unit Tests

2. Integration Tests

3. Functional tests

4. End-to-end testing

5. Acceptance Tests

6. Performance Tests

7. Smoke test
